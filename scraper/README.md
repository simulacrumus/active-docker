## Python Web Scraper - Available Activity Scraper

### About the Project
Active is a mobile application that allows users to browse and search drop-in activities at City of Ottawa Recreation Facilities. 

There is no API available for the drop-in activities and the data for the application is collected using this web scraper. This script provides the essential data for the application by fetching data several times in a day to keep the application data updated.
